## Power System Fault Detection and Classification

A machine learning project that detects and classifies power system faults (e.g., line-to-ground, line-to-line, three-phase) using electrical data like voltage, current, and power load. Trained on a Kaggle dataset and deployed on IBM Watsonx.ai Studio for real-time fault prediction.
